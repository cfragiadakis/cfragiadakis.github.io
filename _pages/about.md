I'm a Data Scientist, currently working at Grant Thornton Greece, focusing on projects that have involved exploratory data analysis, natural language processing, machine learning models and the application of large language models. 

I have completed my Bachelor's degree in the Department of Management Science & Technology at [AUEB](https://www.aueb.gr/), with major in Software Engineering and Data Science. My thesis explored the Advancements in Natural Language Processing. 

Also, I am a research assistant at the University of Sheffield, analyzing hundreds of documents from Greek and foreign press on Greek tourism, using topic modeling techniques to derive insights.

I continuously seek to expand my knowledge, currently learning Keras & Tensorflow.
